Cucumber is very good to do web tests as well in a partnership with Seleniun WebDriver. When we use the extension of selenium and export the test, we see that it is not very human readable, and so it is very hard to understand. This is where Cucumber can help, where we can define the steps and make the tests more human readable. In this exercise see the documentation about Cucumber with Selenium https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/browser-automation/ and implement a small example. THen take the exercise done with selenium in class 3, and we need to adapt it to Cucumber to expect much more readable results.
