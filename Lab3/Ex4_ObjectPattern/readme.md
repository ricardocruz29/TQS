In this tests that we have been doing there are no real problem about the size of the files, and because they are very simple they are easy to understand. But this is not the real world. When doing tests to a website in a company, we need to make it easir to other colleagues to understand the code. We can see that in exercise 2, to some clicks in the website, the amount of code generated was huge. To a real test, this can escalate to something huge that is not understandable.

In this exercise, following this guide: 
https://www.toptal.com/selenium/test-automation-in-selenium-using-page-object-model-and-page-factory
, we can understand an easy way, similar to Program Object Oriented, we can refactor the code to something more escalatable and understandable. Because this example is outdated, we need to refactor it to a new version. 
Check my code as it is very self-explanatory and easy to understand, but remember that when doing some test, this is the correct way to go. Think of other people when trying to read something made by you.
