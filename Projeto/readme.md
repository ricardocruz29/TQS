# AirQuality APP

## Description

This project relies on the development of a web app where it is possible to search air metrics of some citys in the world. In my project, and with the external API I used, I was able to let search by city, and latitude and longitude.
In this project there is also the objective of doing an API to contact with the WebApp and this API must have a cache to store data. 
Last but not least, it should have all the sorts of tests.
